> What if i told you that you can make Elm desktop apps thats feels native?

## Stack

- Nodejs
- Webpack
- Electron framework (Infrastructure)
- Elm (Frontend)
- Golang (Backend/API/ORM)
- MariaDB

## Why

- 'cause i tried to back to develop desktop software (Java & C#) and at least for me... **IT SUCKS!**.
- Plus elm almost guarantee 0% of run time error in production.
- It is more fun code web apps that desktop ones!
