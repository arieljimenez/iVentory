> What if i told you that you can make Elm desktop apps thats feels native?

## Instructions

- With `npm`, just run `$ npm run install`, that will triger a install of __npm__ and __elm__ dependencies.

## Stack

- Nodejs v8.10.0 (npm v5.6.0)
- Webpack 4.2.0
- Electron v1.8.4 + Chromium v59.0.3071.115
- Elm 0.18 (Frontend)
- Golang (Backend/API/ORM)
- MariaDB

## Why

- 'cause i tried to back to develop desktop software (Java & C#) and at least for me... **IT SUCKS!**.
- Plus elm almost guarantee 0% of run time error in production.
- It is more fun code web apps that desktop ones!
